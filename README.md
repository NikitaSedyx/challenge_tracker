npm run build
serve -s build -l 3000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000/challenge_tracker/` to see the production version.

## üì± Installing on Your Phone

The Challenge Tracker is a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means you can install it on your phone like a native app. Here's how:

### iPhone (iOS Safari)

1. **Open Safari** and navigate to your app's URL
2. **Tap the Share button** (square with arrow pointing up) at the bottom of the screen
3. **Scroll down** and tap "Add to Home Screen"
4. **Customize the name** if desired, then tap "Add"
5. The app icon will appear on your home screen

### Android (Chrome)

1. **Open Chrome** and navigate to your app's URL
2. **Tap the menu** (three dots) in the top-right corner
3. **Tap "Add to Home screen"** or look for an "Install" banner at the bottom
4. **Confirm** by tapping "Add" or "Install"
5. The app will be installed and appear in your app drawer

### Alternative Method (Both Platforms)

Many modern browsers will show an **"Install App" banner** automatically when you visit the PWA. Simply tap "Install" when prompted.

## üåê Deploying Your App

To make your Challenge Tracker accessible on phones, you need to deploy it to a web server. Here are several free options:

### Subfolder Deployment

The app is configured to work when deployed to a `/challenge_tracker/` subfolder. This is useful when hosting multiple apps on the same domain.

**Important**: After deployment, your app will be accessible at `https://yourdomain.com/challenge_tracker/`

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)

1. **Build the project**: `npm run build`
2. **Drag the `build` folder** to [netlify.com/drop](https://netlify.com/drop)
3. **Get your URL** and share it with users
4. For automatic deployments, connect your GitHub repository to Netlify

### Option 2: Vercel

1. **Install Vercel CLI**: `npm i -g vercel`
2. **Run**: `vercel` in your project directory
3. **Follow the prompts** to deploy
4. Your app will be live at the provided URL

### Option 3: GitHub Pages

1. **Install gh-pages** (if not already installed): `npm install --save-dev gh-pages`
2. **Deploy**: `npm run deploy` (this will automatically build and deploy)
3. **Access**: Your app will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/challenge_tracker/`

**Note**: The current configuration automatically works with GitHub Pages since the repository name matches the subfolder path. The `predeploy` script automatically runs the build before deployment.

### Option 4: Firebase Hosting

1. **Install Firebase CLI**: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. **Initialize**: `firebase init hosting`
3. **Deploy**: `firebase deploy`

## üé® Customization

### Customizing the Deployment Path

If you need to deploy to a different subfolder path, update the `homepage` field in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "homepage": "/your-custom-path"
}
```

This will make all asset paths use `/your-custom-path/` instead of `/challenge_tracker/`.

### Changing Colors

Edit the CSS custom properties in `src/index.css`:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #4f46e5;
  --success-color: #22c55e;
  --danger-color: #ef4444;
}
```

### Adding More Motivational Quotes

Edit `src/utils/quotes.js` to add your own motivational messages:

```javascript
export const motivationalQuotes = [
  "Your custom quote here! üåü",
  // ... more quotes
];
```

### Modifying the App Name

Update these files:
- `public/manifest.json` - Change `name` and `short_name`
- `public/index.html` - Update `<title>` tag
- `src/components/HomeScreen.js` - Change header title

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### App Not Installing on Phone

- Ensure you're using HTTPS (required for PWA installation)
- Check that the manifest.json is accessible
- Try refreshing the page and looking for install prompts

### Data Not Persisting

- Check if localStorage is enabled in your browser
- Make sure you're not in incognito/private browsing mode
- Clear browser cache and try again

### Offline Not Working

- Ensure the service worker is registered successfully
- Check browser developer tools for service worker errors
- Try reloading the page when online first
